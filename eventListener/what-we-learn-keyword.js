1. different types of events we add different ways
2. direct write on html attribute than execute them
3. and we write a function than write event on html attribute than call them
4. anothe way is direct addEventListener added this is the proper ways
5. how to create elements and add them there parent node
6. how to use input field and interect them to create new html elements and append them on parent nodes
7. we learn extra 2 event handler which are = 1. focus and 2. blur
8. keyboard key related three event are there == 1. keydown, 2. keypress, 3. keyup 
9. keydown cant not always output proper things to print the input item it is too much slow
10. keypress are same like keydown 
11. but most of the time we use keyup cause it is like real time activities and most of the time we do not use keypress, keydown 
 2. we know one more evants which name is 'change'
13. we know what is bubble event and how can it work
14. pass parameter 'event' in any event function means we can control events by using this event parameter like = event.stopPropagation, event.stopImmediatePropagation, event.target.value
15. we can stop bubble events by using event.stopPropagation(); function 
16. one html elements have one and more events if we stop bubble events which output is also parentnodes and we stop by using stopPropagation() in event and we also stop more events in one elements by using stopImmediatePropagation
17. when we getElementById by using any id than we catch an element and than add addeEventListener and if we catch this elements value that is needed a function parameter which name is event(to ocntrol event functionality) and if we add target and value than it will be catch the value of this elements like ==== event.target.value = 'catch the value of element'
18. when we write anything in an empty input field than it will be encripted what you write time to time. so we get this functionality we must write - variableName.value = ''; [for catch the element value we type variableName.value and why we put empty string so that it will be change when we write anything thatr means time to time encrypted ] 

19. what is event delegate ??
====>>> event delegate means deleting or removing elements by using event functionality and we cant remove indivisually by id we deleting by using paremNodes or className etc which are common for us like the reverse method of bubble event, bubble event start with parent than scatter all parent child class but delegate works reverse class to catch parent nodes and execution will be same 
20. mouse event name = 1.mousemove, 2.mouseenter , 3.mouseout 

21. if we add class in createElements by using javascript we use set attribute also we use 'classList.add(className)'
